# Adaptive protection scheme using LIBIEC61850 and RASPBERRY PI

In this repository you could find all the requiered codes for the implementation of an adaptive protection Scheme using IEC61850 protocols.

The real-time simulation test-bed use an OPAL-RT OP4510, a SIMENS SIPROTEC 5 7SL87 device and a RASPBERRI-PI 4.

Within the files you woulf find:

* A simulink model running in MATLAB R2019B with the offline simulation.
* C code of the Auxiliary Protection Unit.
* A .zip file with the configuration of a SIPROTEC 5 device.
* The requiered .icd and .scd files for the process bus creation and definition.

The description of use and function of the protection scheme is explained in .
